package boolrecognition

// BinSearch performs a binary search on s to check if val is present.
// There is a similar function in the sort package (sort.Search), but this one
// uses a function as an argument.
// This makes the approach in sort slower, since binary search is a very
// simple procedure I've reimplemented it here.
//
// This method will return the index of val in the slice if it is present
// and -1 if val is not present.
//
// Some runtime comparisons (slice of size 100000):
// With sort.Search: 10130768 ns/op
// With this method: 7126174 ns/op
// which is a factor of â‰ˆ 1.5
